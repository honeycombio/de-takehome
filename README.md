# DE Takehome - Dockerized Flask API

A compiled Flask API application with a PostgreSQL database. The application provides a large dataset for data analysis and API development testing. 

## What's the Goal

There's a lot of moving pieces here and the idea is for you to spend most of your time on the pieces that align with your strengths. You're an engineer tasked with retrieving data from an api. The stakeholder doesn't know what data is available. Start by hitting an api endpoint to extract data, transform that data as needed, and write the data to postgres. Once written, try to build a cursory analysis of the tables. This can include human-readable analysis as well as additional queries or assets you've created to lend to the analysis. The entire exercise should be less than 2 hours. We realize you can spend 50 hours making this perfect but that is not the goal here. If you want to write advanced idempotent scripts to ETL the data, fine. If you want to manually curl the data and use a tool to restructure it into a csv to import into postgres, also fine! This is more about what you do with the data, less so how you go about it. There is far more than 2 hours of work for any engineer to do so focus your efforts where you will shine. 

An important note is that anything written to postgres is not persisted when you send your assessment in. Please commit any ETL code so that your efforts can be replicated. If performing manual manipulations, please commit the resulting data. Additionally, please commit any further DDL or analysis that you have time for. 

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Ports 5000 and 5433 available on your system

### Running the Application

```bash
# Navigate to the compiled_app directory
cd compiled_app

# Build and start the application
docker-compose up --build

# The API will be available at http://localhost:5000
# PostgreSQL will be available on port 5433
```

### Verifying the Setup

```bash
# Test the API is running
curl http://localhost:5000/

# Check container status
docker-compose ps
```

## üìä Dataset Overview

The application generates a large dataset for analysis:

- **Products**: 12,010 records
- **Suppliers**: 5,005 records  
- **Consumers**: 8,005 records
- **Seeded randomness** for reproducible results

### Data Characteristics
- Seeded random generation for reproducible results
- Realistic business data structure
- JSON API responses
- Database integration ready

## üîå API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /` - API information and dataset stats
- `GET /products` - Get all products (12,010 records)
- `GET /suppliers` - Get all suppliers (5,005 records)
- `GET /consumers` - Get all consumers (8,005 records)

### Relationship Endpoints
- `GET /products/<id>` - Get specific product with supplier info
- `GET /suppliers/<id>/products` - Get products by supplier
- `GET /consumers/<id>/recommendations` - Get product recommendations based on preferences

### Example Usage
```bash
# Get API info
curl http://localhost:5000/

# Get first 5 products
curl http://localhost:5000/products | jq '.products[0:5]'

# Get supplier details
curl http://localhost:5000/suppliers/1

# Get recommendations for consumer
curl http://localhost:5000/consumers/1/recommendations
```

## üóÑÔ∏è PostgreSQL Database

### Connection Details
- **Host**: `localhost` (or `db` from within Docker)
- **Port**: `5432` (mapped to `5433` on host)
- **Database**: `productdb`
- **Username**: `postgres`
- **Password**: `password`

### Database Schema
The database includes pre-created tables:
- `products` - Product catalog with pricing and ratings
- `suppliers` - Supplier information and ratings
- `consumers` - Consumer profiles and preferences

### Connecting to Database
```bash
# From host machine
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U postgres -d productdb

# From within Docker container
docker exec -it compiled_app-flask-app-1 psql -h db -U postgres -d productdb
```

## üîç What to Expect

### For Data Analysis
- Large dataset suitable for performance testing
- Realistic business data structure
- Seeded randomness for reproducible results
- Database integration for complex queries

### For API Development
- RESTful API endpoints
- JSON responses
- Relationship queries between entities

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

### Container Architecture
- **Flask App**: Python 3.10 with compiled bytecode
- **PostgreSQL**: Database with pre-initialized schema
- **Network**: Internal Docker network for service communication

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 5000 and 5433 are available
2. **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
3. **Build failures**: Run `docker-compose down` and rebuild
4. **Wrong directory**: Make sure you're in the `compiled_app` directory

### Useful Commands
```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs flask-app
docker-compose logs db

# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# Clean rebuild
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build

# Access container shell
docker exec -it compiled_app-flask-app-1 bash
```
